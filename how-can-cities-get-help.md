# How can cities get help?

**The truth is that open and agile cities are evolving all the time, and so is the ecosystem that supports them. What once was the sole purview of a handful of city pioneers is now a burgeoning community of city managers, ready and willing to embrace the future mindfully - and with environmental, societal and economic resilience at the core of their approach.**

Like with all good stories, the heroes are never truly alone, and so it is with open and agile smart cities: there is a veritable array of innovators, SMEs, infrastructure providers, financiers, citizen groups, learning institutions and corporate partners that make up the ecosystem helping to keep cities networked, engaged, enlivened and inspired.

Some of the most effective solutions have emerged from within the ecosystem: collaborative working across citiesâ€¦\(Finnish data lakes is just one example\) and it is these solutions that demonstrate the power of multi-lensed connection.

OASC is by cities, for cities - and, with this firmly in mind, it has set its sights on bolstering the power of cities and city ecosystems to meet their challenges head-on as we march further into the data and tech-driven age.

OASC is partnering with a number of enterprise organisations that contribute to the open and agile smart city ecosystem to continue our work in developing the tools and support that cities need.

Over the next 12 months, we will engage with cities and partners to:

* Co-create innovation at scale through EU and other large-scale programmes;
* Continue building out the OASC CITYxCITY Catalogue and Academy;
* Hold the CITYxCITY festival - enabling all sections of the ecosystem to gather in a series of deep dives on the issues, use cases and innovations that drive our movement forward;
* Find new ways to support cities, including through our City Chapters;
* Produce more papers like this one, shining the light on Digital Twins, Data Trusts, AI and more.

If you are interested, OASC is free for cities to join and complimentary services are provided, contact us at [info@oascities.org](mailto:info@oascities.org).
