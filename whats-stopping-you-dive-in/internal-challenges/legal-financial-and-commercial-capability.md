**Commercial negotiations are never easy and cities tend to be at a disadvantage as their legal teams are generally not focused on this type of deal. Yet there is hope; cities can learn from innovators and the possibility of pooling wisdom is tantalising.**

          as part of its urban data platform.</p>
