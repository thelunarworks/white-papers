# Knowhow and awareness: strategic direction

**Determining what data is in your cityâ€™s best interests to control, being able to prioritise value over quantity, and being able to respond agilely within council to new opportunities as they arise requires a depth of understanding in key business areas across the administration.** 

Some larger cities have been able to invest in their data and digital resources with strategic leads in place and governance strategies well-evolved. Others are less able to invest and could benefit from a more collaborative approach. Working out what data your city owns, what it wants to control or manage, and what it would prefer others to manage is key to getting optimum value from your data.
