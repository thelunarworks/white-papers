# Analysis and insights capacity

Strategy and insights go hand in hand and, for cities that have outsourced data management, they are often caught in a defined loop of insights production - unable to vary the demands without cost implications. The power of data is in the insights it can bring, particularly when integrated with more than one source, and cities want to have more flexibility in understanding highly complex issues through different lenses.

A number of companies, large and small, offer a range of tools that support analysis and insights - either in domain-specific areas or across a range of city data.
