# The digital divide and digital literacy

**If cities thought things were fast-moving, communities are also under a veritable tidal wave of new information and ways of transacting everyday life that threatens to swamp all but the most able and aware.** 

The digital divide is such a serious concern that it is being taken up at national and international government levels - with worries that it is impeding productivity and worsening inequalities. Cities are no exception, and with a focus on citizen-centric innovation, they must find ways to keep people engaged and involved, without tech and data becoming a barrier.
