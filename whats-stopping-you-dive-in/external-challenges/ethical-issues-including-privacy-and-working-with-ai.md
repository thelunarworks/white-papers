# Ethical issues, including privacy and working with AI

**Data-driven innovation is throwing up a raft of new ethical dilemmas with which cities are having to wrangle. Data that is consumed by AI or machine-learning devices to generate further insight is a hot topic right now. AI-informed operations are being particularly deployed at spatial level, for example, via traffic cameras or to better understand crowds.** 

One key concern is the extent to which algorithmic learning and decision-making is safe, unbiased, accurate and effective. So, too, is the value of individual privacy in an increasingly surveilled world. Innovators are driving towards solutions for many of these challenges by moving the dial from citizens having to be actively across all engagement with actors seeking to use their data, to spaces in which a person’s intentions are effectively carried through myriad interactions online or via other forms of digital/AI engagement.

In the new data economy, cities are asking searching questions about which data is acceptable to monetise, and which is not. It is possible that some unintended consequences could emerge from data exploitation decisions that leave cities in a legally and morally grey area. The ethical debate surrounding data and tech-driven innovation will continue to evolve as new challenges emerge. While cities are unlikely to want to put themselves at the centre of these debates, it is critical that they continue to engage with the conversation, recognising when consensus has been reached on key elements, and being able to respond appropriately.

Some cities are working ahead of the curve - creating principles to guide their interaction with AI-based innovation and applying it to real-world solutions. OASC will soon produce further guidance on AI - watch this space.
