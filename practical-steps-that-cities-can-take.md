# Practical steps that cities can take

**It is easy to be overwhelmed by the many challenges and opportunities facing cities. One way to begin is to take a single bite - rather than trying to ‘eat the whole elephant’. With this in mind, we suggest that cities wanting to start out on this journey consider three basic steps first:**

* Knowledge is power.
* You can't manage what you can't measure.
* Start with a problem looking for a solution, not the other way around.

### Step 1:

#### **IDENTIFY PRIORITY CHALLENGES THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH BETTER DATA OR IMPROVED DATA MANAGEMENT**

Select a challenge that could be solved through better quality data, or additional information, or through insights derived from the information the city already has access to.

What kind of problem could you focus on and what are the drivers - is it improved efficiency, better budget bottom line, or improved customer service?

Aim for something that is not going to take years to resolve and with clear data boundaries; a distinct issue that - with the help of some good data informatics - will garner support and be matched to a solution is an ideal starting point.

The City of Belfast took this approach when it tackled business rates. The city worked with internal stakeholders to share data across silos, allowing the matching of ratepayers to business addresses more effectively. Using a range of machine learning tools, the project delivered results quickly. The impact was a rise in rate payments and an effective business case for internal stakeholders on why data sharing can add value to the city’s bottom line.

### Step **2:**

#### **CONDUCT A BASIC DATA REVIEW IN THE PRIORITY AREA TO SUPPORT MATCHING THE CHALLENGE WITH A SOLUTION**

Once you have selected a priority issue for the city \(eg. business rates\), finding out what data is being collected, how and by whom is key to understanding the landscape of the problem.

Establish a broad sense of whether the data is quality \(error-free\), how much cleansing is required, whether it can be shared, and how much of it is likely to be useful.

### **Step 3:**

#### **FIND AN URBAN DATA SOLUTION TO MATCH YOUR NEEDS AND DESIGN A PILOT**

Does the problem require a solution that helps to resolve data challenges, or is data that is ready and available necessary for the solution \(or both\)?

For example, in the case of the City of Belfast, the solution meant matching data across silos so that missing information was resolved. This required city teams to share data for the first time in order to match it. The outcome was that ratepayers were charged appropriately and fairly - and the city could recover missing revenue.

Once you have worked out what kind of solution\(s\) you need, consider the ones available on the OASC CITYxCITY Catalogue. You may also find that other cities are willing to talk about the solutions they have implemented.

Design the pilot so that it is clearly sandboxed from other city operations with a manageable timeframe, budget and dedicated resources so that, once the results are through, they are clear and demonstrable. They will act as your call to action for seeking further value from your city’s data.

Your pilot should give you all the evidence you need to make the case internally for using city data to extract greater value \(whether this is financial, insights driven, or operational\).
