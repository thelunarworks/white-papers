# Getting started: where are you right now?

**Cities at the beginning of the data journey are often confronted with myriad choices about where exactly to begin: is it carrying out a root and branch review; carving out ‘priority’ data; enabling random innovation to drive direction, or something else?**

While approaches will vary from city to city, there are many factors at play and there is no one-size-fits-all solution.

### The perfect match: A tactical approach for smaller cities

One question that crosses the minds of urban managers is how much data is enough? 

We now recognise that the question is better framed around matching priorities and challenges to solutions. What data is needed to provide an appropriate solution for the priority at hand, and how do we draw as much value from it? This approach can be a strategic and agile starting point - and also work for bigger cities as an ongoing, cut-through strategy.
